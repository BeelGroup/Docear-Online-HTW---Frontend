# Installation 
1. make sure you have installed a JDK (6 or 7) correctly
    * open a console and enter `javac -version`, that should print your java version, for example `javac 1.6.0_37`
    * you may have to add your Java *bin* folder to the PATH environment variable and open a new console window
1. checkout the project
1. go to the project folder with the console
    * check: `dir` (or `ls` on UNIX) should show you the folders app, conf, project and some more
1. then enter the command `run` or `run.bat`, this may take a while the first time because it downloads a lot of JARs, you my even think that it hangs
